# EmployeeManagment
This project is an Employee Management System built using JavaFX, allowing users to manage employee data. It supports adding, deleting, and calculating salaries for employees, with different types of employment (Full-time, Part-time, and Contract). The system displays employee information, including name, type, and salary, in a list view and enables CRUD operations on employee records. The user interface dynamically updates based on the selected employee type, showing or hiding relevant input fields accordingly. The data is managed in-memory without a database, using an observable list to store employee objects.

Instructions to Use the Employee Management System:
Launch the Application: Run the HelloApplication class to start the program.
Add an Employee:
Enter the employee's name.
Choose the employee type (Full-time, Part-time, or Contract).
For Part-time or Contract employees, enter the hourly rate and relevant working hours.
Click Add to add the employee.
View Employee: Click on an employee in the list to view their details.
Calculate Salaries: Click Calculate Salaries to update the salary for all employees.
Delete an Employee: Select an employee from the list and click Delete to remove them.
The application works entirely in-memory, without a database.
